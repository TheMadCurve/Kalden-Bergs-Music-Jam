# This is Kalden Berg's Music Jam Repository
**Kalden Berg's Music Jam** is a music artist event. This event will invite Twitch music artists to produce music and for the community to vote on their favorite song.

This repository creates a space where people can see participating artists, their songs, then vote after they log in with their Twitch account.

The Twitch log-in will only take email and username information, as a form of authenticity to the voting system. This information, including voting information will be placed on a database on Supabase.
